# Description

Samples the cost for the five qubit linear system presented in the paper at the angles

```python
t = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 25)
```

Note that some raw data has duplicates (50 data points instead of 25) because I accidentally appended each cost twice. So the raw file has the form 

```python
cost1
cost1
cost2
cost2
...
costn
costn
```
